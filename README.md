- 🔭I'm currently working on front-end developing (Vue). In my spare time, I like studying awesome layout.
- 🌱I'm currently learning source code about lodash and ready to share in this repo [Lodash-Source-Code-Analyse](https://github.com/JCHappytime/Lodash-Source-Code-Analyse). If you have any novel idea, welcome to new issue and commit your idea to this repo.😄
- 🌱I'm also currently learning how to publish my own component by NPM, you can check this repo [JComponent-UI](https://github.com/JCHappytime/JComponents-UI). And if you guys have incredible thinking or some components which you think we usually use in our project, welcome to new issue in the repo. If you like, you could also commit your code.😄
- 📫 How to reach me: If you want to contact me, send me email please. Address: Jessica_Jiang_92@163.com❤️

**PS:**<br /> Because I planed maintain my Github last year(2020), there are some problems in my projects. If you found, please let me known by leaving comments.
Any suggestions are welcome!
