- I'm currently working on front-end developing (Vue). In my spare time, I like studying awesome layout.
- I'm currently learning source code about lodash and ready to share in this repo [Lodash-Source-Code-Analyse](https://github.com/JCHappytime/Lodash-Source-Code-Analyse). If you have any novel idea, welcome to new issue and commit your idea to this repo.
